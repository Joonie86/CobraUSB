 * effective_disctype (out): the type of the disc that the system (kernel, vsh, etc) "thinks" is inside.
 * iso_disctype (out): the disc type of the iso mounted, DISC_TYPE_NONE if no iso is mounted
 * 
 * Return values: 0 on sucess, ENOSYS if not in Cobra.

 * Remarks: 
 * Any of the three params can be NULL if you don't need their values.

 * Examples of returned values:
 * 
 * There is a PS3 game in the tray and no iso mounted -> rdt = DISC_TYPE_PS3_BD, eft = DISC_TYPE_PS3_BD, idt = DISC_TYPE_NONE
 * There is a PSX original game in the tray and a iso mounted as normal DVD -> rdt = DISC_TYPE_PSX_CD, edt = DISC_TYPE_DVD, idt = DISC_TYPE_DVD
 * There is no disc in the tray and a PS2 DVD iso is mounted discless -> rdt = DISC_TYPE_NONE, edt = DISC_TYPE_PS2_DVD, idt = DISC_TYPE_PS2_DVD
 * There is a PS2 CD-R in the tray and no iso mounted -> rdt = DISC_TYPE_CD, eft = DISC_TYPE_PS2_CD, idt = DISC_TYPE_NONE
 * There is no disc and no iso is mounted either -> rdt = DISC_TYPE_NONE, edt = DISC_TYPE_NONE, idt = DISC_TYPE_NONE
 * There is no disc, a BD iso is mounted, but disc state is not inserted -> rdt = DISC_TYPE_NONE, edt = DISC_TYPE_NONE, idt = DISC_TYPE_BDMR_SR
 * 
 * Additional info:
 * if an iso is mounted and disc is in inserted state, effective_disctype and iso_disctype are guaranteed to have same value.
 * if disc is in not inserted state and an iso is mounted, then effective_disctype is DISC_TYPE_NONE, but iso_disctype still preserves its value.

 * Even if there is a real disc in the tray, if state is not inserted, then real_disctype is DISC_TYPE_NONE.
 * 
 * If there is a disc in the tray, and no iso is mounted, real_disctype and effective_disctype are guaranteed to have same values except in the following 3 cases:
 * PSX CD-R(W): rdt = DISC_TYPE_CD, edt = DISC_TYPE_PSX_CD
